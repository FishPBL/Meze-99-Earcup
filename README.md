# Meze-99-Earcup
This is a rendition of the Meze 99 earcup released under the Apache license so it can be used, sold, and modified at the users whim.

In the files is a "stock" unmodified earcup intended to be a near replica of the original earcup. They are not a perfect replica, they are much sharper, and more cone-ish.
The other pair of files is a open back variation of the first one.

There are both STL and F3D versions of both earcups provided. 
Neither of the Earcups have been tested as of 9-5-2023.
I am not responcible for any damage to your headphones incurred attemping to install these earcups.
